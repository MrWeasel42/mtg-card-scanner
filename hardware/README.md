# Card sorter hardware (3-bin prototype, rev A)

- `cad/sorter.py`: parametric CadQuery model of every printed part. `python sorter.py` regenerates `stl/` and `step/`.
- `stl/`: print files (one per part; quantities in the print list).
- `step/`: editable solids for any CAD program (Fusion, FreeCAD, Onshape).
- `sheets/`: drawing sheet per part (views, overall dimensions mm (in), quantity, material, print notes).
- `renders/`: final-look and prototype renders.

Machine coordinates: X along the card path, Y across (front = -Y), Z up. Card floor at Z = 205 mm.
First design pass: nothing printed yet. Test-print the gate plate and an exit roller first to check fits.
